in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           
Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          
permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    
and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      
shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   
limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   
personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       
extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           
incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          
limitation may not apply to You.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor.

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.
